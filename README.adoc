= OCP-Workshop

This project is designed to set up a minimal Openshift environment for conducting workshops (training sessions).
These procedures are currently only being developed and tested using RavelloSystems cloud with a known blueprint.

Finally,at the moment this effort is using Openshift Container Platform 3.9 on Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7.5

= Why Another Workshop?

I believe that my philosophy is a little different than most.  Personally, I learn most efficiently by way of "micro successes".  Do something small, succeed and then build up on that success.  I am also very hands-on and learn better with a hammer versus a printed instruction manual.

So rather than devising a complex environment with a complex solution to demonstrate how capable Openshift is, I opt to put it in your hands, start small, build and learn.

Having said that, eventually I do plan to expand this workshop with increasingly complex tasks and exercises.  I want to include Operational tasks like monitoring and troubleshooting along with development tasks like setting up a completely automated CI/CD pipeline.

Lastly, if you are looking for means to get started right away with a tiny openshift environment, I would suggest having a look at Minishift.
