= INSTALLATION

== Download 

Currently working on the 'wsdeployer' branch.  At this time I am not going to differentiate
a workshop installation without the KVM install/config.  It's all or nothing

----
git clone http://github.com/xtophd/OCP4-Workshop --recurse-submodules -b wsdeployer
----

== Config

Create your configs.  Here I'm using the 'nat' network configs
----
ln -s ./OCP4-Workshop/sample-configs/libvirt-nat/* ./OCP4-Workshop/config
----

Fetch the openshift pull secret from Red Hat

----
cp pullsecret.txt ./OCP4-Workshop/config
----

== Install

Run the installation

----
cd ./OCP4-Workshop

bash prepare-kvm-host.sh all
----

= OCP4-Workshop

Foundational exercises to introduce core concepts of Red Hat Openshift Container Platform
