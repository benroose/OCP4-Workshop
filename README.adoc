= OCP3-Workshop

NOTE: *THIS PROJECT IS NOW IN MAINTENANCE MODE.  EFFORTS HAVE SWITCHED TO OCP4*

Foundational exercises to introduce core concepts of Red Hat Openshift Container Platform

Master document for this branch can be found here:

* link:{docsdir}/OCP3-Workshop.adoc[OCP-Workshop Hands-on Lab]

If you are looking for a means to get started right away with a tiny openshift environment, I would suggest having a look at Minishift.
