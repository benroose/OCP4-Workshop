= Preface

This guide is intended to support a series of workshop exercises for individuals getting familiar with Red Hat's Openshift  Container Platform.

This is not an official Red Hat sponsored effort although I am currently employeed by Red Hat.  Rather this is a tool I use to teach myself and those I interact with professionally about new and emerging technologies.

In the spirit of Opensource, I am attempting to make my work publicly accessible for reuse by others.  But be advised that this is my first attempt at using GitHub and ascii-doc. So please be patient as I navigate my way through managing a day job while building out this project (workshop).  At some point I will stop editing in the master branch :-0

NOTE:  This whole effort is done using official Red Hat software and although things can be set up to work with upstream software components (CentOS, Origin, etc...) I currently do not have the bandwidth to support the development and testing of alternate build environments.

= Conventions Used

== Tips, Notes & Warnings

TIP: Extra info which could be helpful, but not essential for a given task or discussion

NOTE: Special information to pay attention

WARNING: Critical information which could help you avoid major set backs

== Executing tasks on the CLI

=== Input

Each block of commands to execute will be label with the expected *user-id* and *host*.  To enhance cut & paste efficiency, the command prompt is omitted from each line.

.[root@master ~]#
----
oc get projects
----

=== Output

Sample output will be titled with _'Your output should look like this'_ and also be indented to help with visual identification.  Sometimes there will also be footnotes and/or callouts.

.Your output should look like this
[source,indent=4]

NAME                                DISPLAY NAME   STATUS

=== Alternate Commands

The workshop often provides scripts to ease certain tasks and reduce the chance for errors.  This helps the class stay on task and reduces the likelyhood of disruption to the workshop delivery.  The native commands which the scripts utilize will be documented in the following way.

.[root@master ~]#
----
cheat-validate-service.sh
----

[NOTE]
====
_Native command(s) to verify POD service_
----
oc get services

curl http://{ip_address}}:8080

=== Using CUT & PASTE For CLI Exercises

The official supported method of participation with this workshop is to use the provided console using a tool called "Shell In a Box".  This tool provides an SLL encrypted SSH session via your web browser.  If it hasn't been mentioned before, Chrome is the preferred browser.

Using CUT & PASTE from this guides to the console is highly recommended and should work.

[NOTE]
====
_Cut & Paste with Linux Desktop_
----
CUT: Select Text with Mouse
PASTE: Center Mouse Click (or possibly a Chorded Mouse Click)
----
====

[NOTE]
====
_Cut & Paste with Windows Desktop_
----
CUT: Select Text with Mouse and then CTL+C
PASTE: Select Browser Window and then CTL+SHIFT+V

I have found that adding a 'space' after the PASTE command works nicely.
